## Description

Lunique Events is an application designed for creating and managing various types of events (educational, concerts, parties, etc.). Users start by creating an account with their email address. They receive a confirmation email with a "magic" link that grants them access to their home page, where they can see all the events they have created.

Users can then create events, specifying required information for guests to register. Using our invitation modal, users can send invites via email. When a guest receives an invitation, they can click the link to go to the event landing page and RSVP.

Event creators can manage their events and view a table of all invited guests along with their RSVP status.

Users who want to create events under the name of an organization (e.g., club, agency) can subscribe to the premium package.
